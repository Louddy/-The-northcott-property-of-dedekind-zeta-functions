# The-northcott-property-of-dedekind-zeta-functions
Repository for the code of the computer assisted part of the project: The northcott property of dedekind zeta functions.

The files [Northcott](Northcott (4.12 and 4.17).ipynb) and [Non-Northcott](Non-Northcott (Proposition 4.19).ipynb
) provide the numerical calculation of the radii of the circles given in Proposition 4.11 and 4.18.

In the file [Interval parsing](Interval_parsing.ipynb), we provide the tools that were used section 5. The main function of this file can be summarised as follows: Depending on the assumptions of the growth of the functions $F$ ang $G$ we calculate the minimal height for intervals of arbitrary precision to be Northcott. This gives an arbitrarily good approximation of Proposition 4.4. Lastly, the file [Intervals](intervs.txt) lists the intervals and their associated heights that were used in the main remarks of section 5.
