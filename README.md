Repository for the code of the computer assisted part of the project: The northcott property of dedekind zeta functions.

Depending on the assumptions of the growth of the functions $F$ ang $G$ we calculate the minimal height for intervals of arbitrary precision to be Northcott. This gives an arbitrarily good approximation of Proposition 4.4.
