Repository for the code of the computer assisted par of the project: The northcott property of dedekind zeta functions

Depending on the assumptions of the growth of the functions $F$ ang $G$ we calculate the minimal height for intervals of arbitrary precision to be Northcott. This gives an arbitrarily good approximation of the weak form of Proposition 4.4. That is, we have applied inequality (6) on Proposition 4.4.
